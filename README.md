IoT-Based Fish Farming using Blynk

Welcome to the IoT-Based Fish Farming project! This repository contains code and instructions for creating an intelligent fish farming system using the Blynk platform. The system monitors pH, salinity, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and temperature using an Arduino Uno and various sensors. This project is designed to help fish farmers maintain optimal water conditions, ensuring healthy and productive fish farming.

Features

pH Detection: Monitors the pH level of the water to ensure it is within the optimal range for fish health.

Salinity Detection: Measures the salinity of the water, which is crucial for species that require specific salt concentrations.

TDS Detection: Monitors the total dissolved solids in the water to ensure a clean and safe environment for the fish.

Temperature Monitoring: Keeps track of the water temperature to maintain a suitable environment for the fish.

Blynk Integration: Real-time monitoring and control through the Blynk mobile app, providing remote access and notifications.//

Components

Arduino Uno: The microcontroller used to interface with the sensors and the Blynk platform.

pH Sensor: Measures the acidity or alkalinity of the water.

Salinity Sensor: Detects the salt concentration in the water.

TDS Sensor: Measures the concentration of dissolved solids in the water

Temperature Sensor: Monitors the water temperature.

Blynk App: Used for real-time monitoring and control.
